        During the first semester of my senior year, there was an opening in my schedule. After some convincing, I decided to choose ceramics, with some hesitation because of the demands that come with that median. Starting that class was difficult because of how disconnected I was from
art. However, the potter's wheel really piqued my interest. Something about how people made bowls and vases spoke to me. This art style really pulled me in and my curiosity got the better of me I started working on getting the technique down, struggling through, and making a mess. In the second week, I started feeling more comfortable with the wheel and being able to center the clay. When I had extra time I would even get extra practice after school. By the end of the month, I was able to raise and create solid shapes consistently. Finally, my first bowl was complete, with smooth edges, and a really even shape.
I was extremely happy that I was accomplished something I never thought I could before. After seeing my teacher happily amazed with my piece, I regret neglecting art all these years.<br><br>

        Joining the band as a freshman had its setbacks, but I was determined to develop my skills to catch up to the best at my school. Most of my free time during my high school career was spent practicing marimba. During rehearsals, I would bombard my instructors and leaders with questions and tips on how to become better. Sometimes I would practice the second I got home from rehearsal. My hands dripped in blood because of the blisters after overplaying, but rep after rep I knew this was the instrument for me.

Today I can play college-level repertoire with solid technique and sound quality. I demonstrated strong performances during competitions and was one of the best. During my junior year, I decided to audition for the Mandarins, a top 10 world-class drum corp. With my greatest efforts, I was able to receive a call back which was a rare result, especially for high school students. Although I didn't make the cut, I was proud my development was noticed and considered by some of the best in the industry.

Moving forward, I plan to audition for the drum corps again. I want to go onto the national stage in Indianapolis and throw it down with some of the best players in America. The hard work proved that I had something to show. I was no longer that cousin who was just average at family reunions anymore.
